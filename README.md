# Mendix Model Components
Useful components to generate Mendix app models with the Mendix Model SDK

## Usage

You do not need to directly clone this source code repository to be able to use it, because we have published an npm package.

Instead, in your own project, run:

	npm install mendixmodelcomponents

## Building

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have `patch` installed.
On Windows, you can install it with e.g. cygwin. If you have installed a git distribution, you usually already have it installed. Check it by running e.g. `patch --version`.
